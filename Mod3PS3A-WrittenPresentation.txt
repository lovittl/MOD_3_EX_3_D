Double Entry Accounting System
==============================

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Roy Lovitt with the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy Cloud Application
Developer Cohort at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Jacksonville Florida.  I'll be 
presenting the week 3 project Double Entry Accounting System Prototype.  

## Progress to this week

Up to this point we have progressed to the point of displaying 5 menu item choices
delivered in a C# console appliction.  

Menu items:

  * Check Balances
  * View Account
  * Enter Transaction
  * View Reports
  * Exit

## Program execution

As the program starts the user is presented with a Windows command line Console Window with Main Menu
instructions to make a choice from the above 5 options. 

code execution begins in the first line of the Main Methond after the opening curly brace.
the integer variable selection is initialized and assigned a value of 0.
program control then continues by entering a do loop and the method DisplayMenu() is called.
Control then continues on line 44 where the Main Menu is displayed and the uer is presented with selections
he or she can make.  
using System;

namespace Mod3Ex3D
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Initialize variable to control menu selection
            int selection = 0;

            do
            {
                DisplayMenu();
                selection = ReadInt();

                //Select matching case attribute returned from method ReadInt
                switch (selection)
                {
                    case 1:
                        //send control to method CheckBalances()
                        CheckBalances();
                        break;
                    case 2:
                        //send control to method ViewAccount()
                        ViewAccount();
                        break;
                    case 3:
                        //send control to method EnterTransaction()
                        EnterTransaction();
                        break;
                    case 4:
                        //send control to method ViewReports()
                        ViewReports();
                        break;
                }

            }

            while (selection != 5);

        }

        private static void DisplayMenu()
        {

            Console.WriteLine("MAIN MENU");

            Console.WriteLine("Please make a choice from the following list and hit enter");
            Console.WriteLine("1)Check Balances, 2)View Account, 3)Enter Transaction, 4)View Reports, 5)Exit");

        }

        private static void EnterTransaction()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Case 3");
        }

        private static void ViewReports()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Case 4");
        }

        //Get user input and verify it was correctly entered
        private static int ReadInt()
        {
            var validInput = false;
            int val = 0;

            do
            {
                try
                {
                    val = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
                    validInput = true;
                }
                catch (FormatException)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine("Invalid selection. Try Again");
                }
            }
            while (!validInput);

            return val;
        }
    }
